# Olist Ecommerce Dataset Portfolio

Welcome to the Olist Ecommerce Dataset Portfolio repository! This project showcases analysis, modeling, and insights derived from the Olist ecommerce dataset, which contains information about more than 100,000 orders, customers, products, sellers, and reviews from a Brazilian ecommerce platform.

## Dataset Highlights

- The dataset is based on over 100,000 completed orders.
- Each customer in the dataset appears only once; there are no repeat customers, as per the data.
- This structure means churn analysis (identifying repeat and lost customers) cannot be performed, as the data does not track customer activity beyond their first purchase.
- The data includes various tables: orders, customers, order items, products, payments, reviews, and more.
- Useful for exploring order patterns, customer demographics, product performance, seller behavior, and review analysis.
